          <h3>At what stage does Crosspring invest?</h3>
          <p class="project-p">Crosspring invests in early stage digital startups. Usually we get involved around the
            stage that the startup has a few first paying clients and are now ready to start growing faster.</p>
          <p class="project-p">Depending on the previous experience of the founding team in combination with the
            GTM-strategy, we sometimes get involved around the MPV-stage as well.

          <h3>What are Crosspring Investment criteria?</h3>
          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li class="styled-list-item">Startups preferably have a <span class="bold-text">complementary team of at
                least 2-3 people</span>, meaning
              we
              don't invest in sole
              founders.</li>
            <li class="styled-list-item">As we invest in software startups, it is important that there is
              <span class="bold-text">at least a strong technical co-founder</span> on
              board. The ideal team contains at least a developer, a designer and a commercial person.
            </li>
            <li class="styled-list-item">Next to that, it is important that the concept <span class="bold-text">
                fits with our own vision,
                experience and network
              </span> in that
              industry.</li>
            <li class="styled-list-item">Lastly, startups should be very <span class="bold-text">data driven</span> and
              always have a very customer
              centric approach.</li>
          </ul>

        <article class="faq-item-3">
          <h3>What Does Crosspring offer in addition to the financial funding?</h3>
          <p class="p-mb">We are an active investor and like to go on this exciting journey together. This also means that
            we don't invest in a company if we have the feeling that we cannot add much value next to the money. With
            decades of experience in bringing innovative companies to market, we know what the difficulties are.</p>
          <p>
            We
            support our portfolio companies with hands-on <span class="bold-text">support across the whole range</span>
            of troubles (and successes!)
            they encounter. Sometimes this only means acting as a <span class="bold-text">soundboard</span> every now
            and again, but it can also mean
            providing <span class="bold-text">living- and office space, daily mentoring</span>, facilitating the <span
              class="bold-text">startup visa</span>, introductions to our
            <span class="bold-text">international network</span>, support in <span class="bold-text">raising
              money</span> etc. It all depends on what a startup needs. Our program is
            <span class="bold-text">always tailor made</span>.
          </p>

                href="https://crosspring.com/erasmus-for-young-entrepreneurs/">Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs

          </div>

          <p class="p-mb">Crosspring invests in early stage digital tech startups. As we find it important to add value to a company in the form of business
            support, knowledge and a relevant network, we don't invest in concepts that are too far off from these focus
            areas.</p>
          <p class="p-mb">Furthermore, we don't feel comfortable investing in sole founders, so we would like to see at least 2-3
            people in the team before we consider to invest.</p>
          <p class="p-mb">Crosspring broadly invests in industries as <span class="bold-text">FinTech</span>, <span class="bold-text">AR/VR</span>, <span class="bold-text">Cyber Security</span>, <span class="bold-text">B2B SaaS</span>, <span class="bold-text">AI</span> and <span class="bold-text">Agri-tech</span>. Of
            course, we realise that it can be hard categorise your startup in any of these industries. We understand
            that there is a lot overlap and grey zones here. So, if you're not sure, feel free to reach out so we can
            have a look at it together.</p>
          <p class="p-mb">Next to that, we have a clear preference for software concepts. This means that we are not the right
            partner if your concept contains a strong reliance on very specific or 'to-be-developed' hardware.</p>
          <p class="p-mb">The location of a startup needs to make sense for their business activities in the first place. So startups
            at least should be able to show a clear reasoning for their current- and planned geographical location. Not
            only for us, but especially for themselves.</p>
          <p class="p-mb">Over the years we have invested in startups that are based all across Europe and that typically have very
            cultural diverse teams. We have a strong international network and like to explore new investment
            opportunities and international collaborations all the time.</p>
          <ol class="p-mb">
            <li>To quickly determine if we are the right investment partner for a startup, we like to receive a clear
              and concise pitch deck. Send it to <a class="link"
                href="mailto:info@crosspring.nl">info@crosspring.com</a>, we try to review it within one week usually.
            </li>
            <li>We ask clarification questions if needed and try to determine if the startup has a potential fit for
              investment. If so, we schedule a video-call for further introductions and to discuss your plans in more
              detail.</li>
            <li>If after the first video-call there is still interest on both sides, we start a more thorough due
              dilligence and often will request more information about the technical / financial side of things. Usually
              we discuss this over one or two more calls or face-to-face meetings.</li>
            <li> In some cases we request talking to other committed investors or to the startups clients to get another
              perspective from a third party stakeholder.</li>
            <li>Deal terms are always discussed and negotiated on a case-to-case basis.
            </li>
          </ol>

            <img class="center-img" src="img/pitchdeck.svg" alt="illustration of person next to stats">
            <p class="p-mb">A good pitch deck helps to spark initial interest. Make sure it's clear, well designed and to the point.
              Do
              not dwell on too many specifics, we can look at that later. In the pitch deck you include information in a
              structure similar to this:</p>
            <ul class="ul-col">
              <li class="styled-list-item">Startup name and a sentence that explains your startup's activities in one
